<p>There are no downsides to choosing this path to hike. Unless you decide to go during the cold winter or end up being unprepared, lacking the tools needed.</p>
<p>Let's begin by setting the scene of every hikers dream: the picture perfect hike. It is the season of autumn and the morning's weather is much cooler compared to during the day. It's about 10 degrees and sunny, with a little bit of a breeze. No phones, no distractions. Just the sounds of birds chirping and the wind breezing through your hair. You decide to stop at the side of the trail and take a glance at the view. It is a line of trees painted in red, yellow, orange and green colours moving slightly because of the wind. </p>
